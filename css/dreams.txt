what course are we going to do;
Are you going for software or website;
Software developers earn more than web developers;
I am in it for the love of it and the money;
I was going for software;
We can start stockexchange;
With 10 bucks and start pridicting the stocks;\
It is 100% or 200% profit;
Thats is crazy;
TO be a professional you need to pick a side;
But that would get you all preoccupied;
I have a liking for web development but it does not fetch alot of money;

IF my wassce result is great iwould go for petroleum;
And do software as a side job ____ The greatest insult any programmer or software developer would ever get!

167000$ is alot of money for a year but 110000$ is relatively low for a prof web developer
